## Contributing to open source

If you haven’t been involved in an open source project before, it can be intimidating to start participating. Here are a few tips to get comfortable: 

*Feel free to lurk*

• Seeing how other community members interact will help you adjust and learn the social norms in the community

*[Read our Code of Conduct](https://github.com/lfph/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)*

• We’ve set and enforce high standards of professional practice from everyone you’ll be meeting

*No stupid questions*

• Not sure what someone meant? Need help learning to use a tool? Ask lots of questions and let the community support you.

*Don’t wait for an invitation*

• Our tools and meetings are open by default, so jump in and introduce yourself, ask questions and share ideas
